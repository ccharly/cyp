# set
set() -> new empty set object
set(iterable) -> new set object

Build an unordered collection of unique elements.
- - -

## set.add
Add an element to a set.

This has no effect if the element is already present.
- - -

## set.clear
Remove all elements from this set.
- - -

## set.copy
Return a shallow copy of a set.
- - -

## set.difference
Return the difference of two or more sets as a new set.

(i.e. all elements that are in this set but not the others.)
- - -

## set.difference_update
Remove all elements of another set from this set.
- - -

## set.discard
Remove an element from a set if it is a member.

If the element is not a member, do nothing.
- - -

## set.intersection
Return the intersection of two sets as a new set.

(i.e. all elements that are in both sets.)
- - -

## set.intersection_update
Update a set with the intersection of itself and another.
- - -

## set.isdisjoint
Return True if two sets have a null intersection.
- - -

## set.issubset
Report whether another set contains this set.
- - -

## set.issuperset
Report whether this set contains another set.
- - -

## set.pop
Remove and return an arbitrary set element.
Raises KeyError if the set is empty.
- - -

## set.remove
Remove an element from a set; it must be a member.

If the element is not a member, raise a KeyError.
- - -

## set.symmetric_difference
Return the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set.

(i.e. all elements that are in exactly one of the sets.)
- - -

## set.symmetric_difference_update
Update a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another.
- - -

## set.union
Return the union of sets as a new set.

(i.e. all elements that are in either set.)
- - -

## set.update
Update a set with the union of itself and others.
